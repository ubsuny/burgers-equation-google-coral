### P1
I'm having troubles with building up tensorflow on my device, Google Coral Dev Board and I have to run it in a normal computer. The visualization plots are not quite convinient to see since each step goes too quickly so I adjust it to show the plot after every 10 iterations. As it turns out 1000 steps will take around 10 seconds and the same time is taken for the next 1000 loops.


### P2
As written in the [repo](https://github.com/okada39/pinn_burgers), we could simply utilize defined functions to get the same results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561.pdf).
